My broad skillset allows me to design and implement clean and elegant user experiences across web, mobile, and proprietary touch devices. I love my job.

Epiphany Eyewear
Consumer targeted video sunglasses in the wearables sector, allowing users to stylishly and affordably record, share, and edit video through a mobile device and browser.

I collaborated with the CEO and product designer to create the branding for the product, marketing and packaging materials, and the user interface design for the software.

YouGen.tv
I lead product research, interface design, and user experience design for YouGen.tv, Vergence Labs' point-of-view video streaming social network, allowing Epiphany Eyewear users to seamlessly upload, edit, and share video from their device.

Tapjoy Marketplace
As part of the Tapjoy design team, I designed each interaction for the Tapjoy Marketplace across iOS and Android. During rapid growth, I aided in overhauling the company visual design and branding, while also simplifying the app navigation, information architecture, and social features.

I also incorporated an achievement system to encourage users to engage in the marketplace and to retain users through progression within the app.
